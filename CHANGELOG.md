## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- pressing the belt **Stop** switch no longer drops the BLE connection
  and silently flips the **Stay connected** toggle off when the user
  has opted in to a persistent connection. The deferred-disconnect now
  only fires when the belt switch had to flip `stay_connected` on for
  the duration of the walk (i.e. it was off beforehand).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- speed control on KingSmith MC-21 (and other models exposing the
  vendor pre-amble characteristic) — bumps `walkingpad-controller`
  to 0.4.1, which writes the required pre-amble before each FTMS
  Control Point command and tolerates `REQUEST_CONTROL` rejection.
  See [walkingpad-controller#1](https://github.com/mcdax/walkingpad-controller/issues/1).
